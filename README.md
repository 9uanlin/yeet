# yeet ðŸš€

## A launcher for those too lazy to click through their bookmarks bar
During the pandemic I got annoyed of having to click through my bookmarks bar everyday to open all the websites I needed for school... and thus, yeet was born, a quick-launcher Chrome extension that allows users to open all the tabs they need for work in one click.

## Getting Started

To try yeet for yourself, follow these simple steps.

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/9uanlin/yeet.git
```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click "Developer mode" in the top right hand corner
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Go to whichever directory you cloned the repo to and select `yeet-main`
6. Click on the "extensions" icon in the top right hand corner of Chrome and pin `yeet` for easy use!

## Final Notes

This was developed in half a day on a time crunch, so it is definitely not the cleanest code or design. I plan on coming back and doing a major refactoring (and maybe even publishing it to the Chrome Web Store ðŸ˜³) when I have time.
